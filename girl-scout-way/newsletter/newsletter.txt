    The Girl Scout Way badge celebrates traditions and the Girl Scout promise.


    I will do my best to be
        honest and fair,
        friendly and helpful,
        considerate and caring,
        courageous and strong, and
        responsible for what I say and do,
    and to
        respect myself and others,
        respect authority,
        use resources wisely,
        make the world a better place, and
        be a sister to every Girl Scout.

Democracy badge gets attention from governor, senator, mayor

We sent our last newsletter about the Democracy badge workshop to local, state, and national elected officials. Several officials wrote back with their reactions to the work the Scouts did. Joe Wise, mayor of Johnson City at the time, wrote in his email reply, "I share your hope that our public service will be marked by kindness and respect." Governor Bill Lee looks "forward to working with [us] and all Tennesseans to make our state the best place to live and work," according to his letter. 

"Too few young Tennesseans understand how our government is organized and how it all works to provide all those things that our families require in order to lead the lives we lead," wrote state senator Rusty Crowe. "Thank you for all you are doing!!" Senator Crowe sent a case of copies of "A Student's Guide to the Tennesse Senate" to share with the troop, family, and friends.

Traditions are not trivial in the Girl Scouts

The Girl Scouts Way badge asks scouts to learn about traditions. One of the most important traditions handed down from Girl Scouts founder Juliette Gordon Low was that we sometimes need to break with tradition.

Juliette was born in 1861, when women were expected to fill the role of wife and mother. But her circumstances led her to live a rather unconventional life! 

Our workshop included a trivia contest based on "Who Was Juliette Gordon Low?", a biography of Juliette and the early history of the Girl Scouts. Give these questions a try!

1. What has Juliette's nick name?
