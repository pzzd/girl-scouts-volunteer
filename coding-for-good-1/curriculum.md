Badge for Daisies: Coding for Good 1: Coding Basics


### Materials for presenter






Day 1: Everyone

Hello, Scouts! Today we are working on the Coding Basics badge. What are coding basics?

Coding, or computer programming, is the process of designing a program to perform a particular task using a computer. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming)

What is a program? It is a sequence of instructions in a programming language that a computer can do or understand. "Sequence" means the instructions are in a certain order. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program)

Another name for a program is algorithm. An algorithm is a sequence of well-defined instructions. An algorithm is used to solve problems like math calculations, saving or changing data, or making decisions. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm)

Let's try an example. ASSISTANT: Please add 365 and 78. Write down the answer and show it to me.

ASSISTANT showed me the answer is 443. In this example, I am the coder. I made an algorithm: I made  instructions about solving a math problem. Then I gave the instructions to ASSISTANT, and she followed the instructions. That means ASSISTANT is the computer! 

Let's try some more examples. Daisy: Tell me how old you are. Brownie: Tell me what day it is. Junior: Multiply 2 and 3. Then clap that many times.

In all these examples I made instructions and gave them to my computers to perform.

Let's do one more example. This time you are all the coders, and I would like you to program my sandwich-making robot to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. You tell me the instructions. I will write them down in




first computer: humans!

Charles Babbage, mathematician in 1800s, is called the 'father of computers'. He designed a couple machines  for making very difficult calculations. One of these machines was the Analytical Engine. It was designed in 1837. There was a big difference: the AE was mechanical, meaning it was a machine with moving parts, like a machine in a factory or a clock. But this machine had special characteristics: 

it had a memory: it could store numbers using wheels
it could do arithmetic: adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing, and comparing numbers
it could make a very simple choices: e.g.,  if the answer is greater than 0, subtract 1; if the answer is 0, stopping running.
it could loop through arithmetic and choices, repeating those steps again and again
it took input: the AE was programmed with punch cards
it made output: it had a printer and a bell, and could punch cards on its own

Because of these characteristics, many people consider the AE to be the first modern computer: it has a lot  of the behavior of your parent's laptop or the phone in your pocket.

but the analytical engine was never built! Charles Babbage wrote about it and talked about it a lot to scientists, mathematicians, and friends. One of those mathematicians and friends was Ada Lovelace. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_Engine)

Ask scouts about Ada Lovelace, Grace Hopper, Dorothy Vaughan, Margaret Hamilton. Fill in any gaps. 


Ada Lovelace: Mathematician and writer. Daughter of a mathematician mother and poet father. Her mother hired private tutors for science and mathematics, and very much intersted in math by the time she met Charles Babbage when she met him at the age of 18. She learned about his AE from an article. She wrote up notes explaining how the AE would work, and consulted with Babbage about it, and publishe her notes. Her notes  expanded on the idea of this machine quite a lot. She came up with a way to program it to perform complicated calculations, using only the rules about how such a machine might work. This "way to program it", to many people, is the first computer program. She also thought a machine could be used for more than just performing calculations: a machine could be used to represent other things like letters,  musical notes, or other symbols, and apply rules to them, and to make operations on them.

Her contribution: collaborating with others, explaining a mechanical computer to others, coming up with the idea for how to use computers beyond just math. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace)

Grace Hopper: Computer scientist and US Navy rear admiral; worked at several corporations too. Invented one of the first compilers. Led the release of some of the first compiled computer languages. Before that, programmers had to write unreadable machine code.  "It's much easier for most people to write an English statement than it is to use symbols. So I decided data processors ought to be able to write their programs in English, and the computers would translate them into machine code." That is what a compiler does! A compiler makes it easier to write code, which means more people can do it quickly and successfully. (	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper)

Dorothy Vaughan: Very strong student, went to college to study mathematics. Mathematician, human computer, teacher; worked in federal government starting in WW2, continued at NASA during the 'space race'. There was a great demand for computing: making very complicated mathematical calculations for targeting weapons, processing research data, and launching rockets into space. Contribution to computer science was preparing for introduction of machine computers by teaching herself and her staff the programming language called Fortran. Why were human computers replaced by machine computers? (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Vaughan)

Margaret Hamilton: Mathematics professor, computer scientist, systems engineer, business owner. Led a team that built software for NASA to fly the Apollo space module and land it on the moon. Her team also built error detection and recovery software. She learned with hands-on experience because there were not many computer science classes  and software engineering did not exist. In fact, Margaret came up with the term 'software engineering'. Here contributions were making 'software engineering' a subject you can study and take seriously: design an entire system of software, model a process with code, figure out how to reuse code, quality assurance and testing(to make sure the coding is good and reliable), human-machine interfaces (this is the part of a program that a human sees and uses). This made her code incredibly reliable because they helped programmers identify problems before the code was put to use. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton_(software_engineer))

What did they have in common?
They enjoyed learning new things. They shared what they knew with others and taught others. They were ready for new technology by having a lot of experience in math. Having learned a lot, they were ready to receive a new technology and put it to use in new ways.

Being ready is important! That is what we are doing today. We are going to talk about coding basics. But outside of today's workshop you should continue getting ready! How can you do that? Take your school work seriously, work on your math and reading, talk to your teachers when you have questions or ideas.
