GS Way Badge

~Overview~

Recently, the Girl Scouts of Troop 622 participated in in the Girl Scout Way Badge workshop, led by Miss Rose. They all participated in 5 different activities:

- Make some SWAPs
- Sing in the Async-Along
- Participate in the Girl Scout trivia contest
- Make the world a better place
- Read "Who was Juliette Gordon Low"


~Async-Along~

For one of the requirements of the badge, we all had to sing a song together. We can't sing together in person because of the pandemic, but we *can* sing into yout voicemail!
