GS Way Badge

~Overview~

Recently, the Girl Scouts of Troop 622 participated in in the Girl Scout Way Badge workshop, led by Miss Rose. They all participated in 5 different activities:

- Make some SWAPs
- Sing in the Async-Along
- Participate in the Girl Scout trivia contest
- Make the world a better place
- Read "Who was Juliette Gordon Low"

~AsyncAlong~

For one of the requirements of the badge, we all had to sing a song together. We can't sing together in person because of the pandemic, but we *can* sing into a voicemail! We all called a phone number and sang a few verses of "She'll be Coming 'Round the Mountain" into the voicemail. Then troop volunteer Miss Rose put all of our voices together in a song-editing app so we sound like we're all singing at the same time! We made a [YouTube video]{link} of it, so you can hear it too.
